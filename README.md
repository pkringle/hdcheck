# hd-check.sh
I wrote this simple shell script to help wipe old harddrives, and also check them for bad sectors.
Average run time of this script is about 8+ hours depending on the size.

Please note, this is a DESTRUCTIVE test.  It will wipe ALL data off your disk.

## Example Usage
```shell
./hd-check.sh sda
```
